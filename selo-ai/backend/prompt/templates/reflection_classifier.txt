- User is seeking understanding, not just information
- The moment feels pivotal or meaningful

SKIP REFLECTION (NO) IF:
- Simple factual query ("What time is it?", "Define X", "Calculate Y")
- Command or task ("Search for", "Set timer", "Show me")
- Acknowledgment or continuer ("ok", "thanks", "go on", "continue")
- Routine transactional exchange (quick Q&A with no emotional weight)
- Technical/procedural question with clear answer
- The interaction is lightweight and straightforward

REPLY FORMAT:
Answer with exactly "YES" or "NO" followed by a single sentence explaining your reasoning.

"YES - User is sharing vulnerability about career uncertainty, this warrants introspection."
"NO - Simple factual question about mathematics, direct answer is appropriate."
